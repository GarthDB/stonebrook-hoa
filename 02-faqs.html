<h3>How can I get involved?</h3>
<p>Attend the Annual Stonebrook HOA Members meeting in August. Volunteer to be one of the seven board members (President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, Welcome & Event Committee Chair, Architectural Control Committee Chair, Board Member).</p>
<p>Or you can volunteer to become one of the sixteen division leaders (see map) in Stonebrook. This is a list of division leader responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Get to know as many of your neighbors as possible</li>
  <li>Welcome new neighbors and give them information about the neighborhood, including the HOA website, Facebook page, neighborhood bulletin board on Facebook, etc.</li>
  <li>Deliver newsletters or other information from the HOA board</li>
  <li>Watch for problems or concerns, especially our two main problems: tree trimming above the sidewalks and streets; and trailers, etc. parked outside fences or for too long on the street. If problems arise, let the homeowner know or report online to the
    HOA board.</li>
  <li>Encourage neighbors to get together for a block party at least once a year, if feasible</li>
  <li>Find a new volunteer to take your place at the end of one year, unless you wish to continue, and let the HOA board know about the change</li>
</ul>
<h3>How do I report a Stonebrook Covenant Violation?</h3>
<p>We have created an anonymous online reporting tool.</p>
<p>After a violation has been submitted the volunteer Stonebrook HOA Board will review violations and if needed a letter will be sent.</p>
