  <h1>Complying with Idaho Code Section 55-115</h1>
  <p>Pursuant to <a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idstat/title55/t55ch1/sect55-115/">Idaho Code Section 55-115</a>, the Stonebrook HOA board is required to use the following approach in cases where violations of the covenants and restrictions
    have occurred:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>When a violation has been identified, a letter is sent to the homeowner by certified mail or personal delivery.</li>
    <li>The letter provides the homeowner with written notice of an HOA board meeting to take place 30-35 days later.</li>
    <li>At the meeting, the board will vote on whether to impose a fine for the conduct. The homeowner will be invited to the meeting.</li>
    <li>If the homeowner resolves the issue prior to the meeting, then by law the board may not impose a fine.</li>
    <li>If the violation cannot reasonably be resolved within the 30-day period, no fine can legally be imposed if the homeowner "begins resolving the violation prior to the meeting" and thereafter "continues to address the violation in good faith until fully
      resolved."</li>
    <li>If the issue is not resolved and no resolution has begun by the time of the meeting, the board will vote whether or not to impose a fine for the violation.</li>
  </ul>
